# Image-prompt-viewer-for-stable-diffusion
application for viewing Stable Diffusion generated images prompt from metadata.

i made this because windows doesn't seem to show the custom parameter where the prompt and other info is stored in an image, and other metadata apps that do show the parameter show as one long string of text
my app formats the text appropriately

note: this won't give you the prompt used from SD images from the web as most sites scub the metadata from the image
this is only useful for keeping track of prompts used for your own locally generated images
